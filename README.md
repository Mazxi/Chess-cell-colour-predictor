# Chess-cell-colour-predictor
Chess is a board game for two players, called White and Black, each controlling an army of chess pieces in their color, with the objective to checkmate the opponent's king.
I wrote this program that accepts cells on a chess board and tells the user is the colour of that cell is white or black, due to my passion for playing chess.

## Code work through
I first created a list of English alphabets from A to H and a list from 1 to 8 then created an empty list for white and another for black. Then i created a nexted for loop to fill the two empty list which used in the if statement in the last code block to check if the chess cell inputs used where white or black.
